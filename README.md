# RayshaderMaps

This repository contains my projects for creating 3D population density maps using the [`rayshader`](https://www.rayshader.com/) package in R. The data is sourced from the [Kontur Population Dataset 2022](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-dataset), which estimates worldwide population in 400m hexagonal geometries using a combination of various sources.

The maps are presented at an angle to better illustrate heights, and the texts and labels are added using Adobe Illustrator.

###### Portraits were created on 19.06.2023 using data from [Kontur's 2022 Global Population Density for 400m H3 Hexagons](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-dataset).

I appreciate any feedback as I continue to learn and explore data visualization, especially regarding aesthetics.
